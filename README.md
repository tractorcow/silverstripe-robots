# Robots.txt generation module for Silverstripe

This module provides simple robots.txt generation for Silverstripe, with various configuration
options available.

When a site is not in live mode (such as on a testing domain) it will respectively
block the entire domain, ensuring that (at least respectful) search engines will
refrain from indexing your test site.

This doesn't support complex rules (such as multiple rules for different user agents),
as it's designed to cater to the 99.9% of cases which won't require manual configuration.

## Credits and Authors

 * Damian Mooyman - <https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-robots>

## Requirements

 * Silverstripe 6

## Installation Instructions

 * Extract all files into the 'robots' folder under your Silverstripe root, or install using composer

```bash
composer require "tractorcow/silverstripe-robots": "^5"
```

 * Make sure you are correctly setting your environment for it to work properly
 * It's also advisable to either install the googlesitemaps module, or to create a physical `sitemap.xml` in your site root.

## Configuration

You can add a page or pattern to be blocked by adding it to the disallowedUrls configuration

```yaml
---
Name: myrobotsconfiguration
---
TractorCow\Robots\Robots:
  disallowed_urls:
    - 'mysecretpage.html'
    - '_private'
    - 'Documents-and-Settings/Ricky/My-Documents/faxes/sent-faxes'
```

Also by default, any page with 'ShowInSearch' set to false will also be excluded. This
can be useful for hiding auxilary pages like "thanks for signing up", or error pages.

You can turn this off (if you really absolutely think you need to) using the below

```yaml
---
Name: myrobotsconfiguration
---
TractorCow\Robots\Robots:
  disallow_unsearchable: false
```

By default the module will check for a sitemap file in `/sitemap.xml`, or will assume
one is there if the googlesitemap module is installed. You can set a custom file location
using the below configuration.

```yaml
---
Name: myrobotsconfiguration
---
TractorCow\Robots\Robots:
  sitemap: '/sitemap_index.xml'
```
